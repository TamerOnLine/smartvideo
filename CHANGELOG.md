---
## [0.1.6] - 2025-10-30
### Added
- Added automatic FFmpeg/FFprobe download for **Linux** and **macOS** (static builds & universal binaries).
- Added architecture detection (x86_64, arm64, aarch64) with safe mirror fallback.
- Added cross-platform chmod handling to ensure executables are runnable.

### Changed
- Unified `ensure_binaries()` logic for Windows/Linux/macOS under one consistent pipeline.
- Improved logging messages during download and extraction (shows MB progress).

### Fixed
- Cleanup routines now safely remove temporary archives and extracted folders.
- Ensured extracted FFmpeg binaries retain executable permissions across systems.

---

## [0.1.5] - 2025-10-30
### Added
- Fallback mirrors for Windows FFmpeg download (release + git essentials).
- Progress and size logging during download with clearer messages.

### Changed
- Hardened resolver flow (ENV ‚Üí PATH ‚Üí packaged ‚Üí cached ‚Üí auto-download).
- More informative errors and cleanup of temp files after extraction.

### Fixed
- Correct FFmpeg URL (fixed 404) and prevented 500 on first upload.
- Reliable extraction & caching in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/SmartVideo/bin`.

---

## [0.1.4] - 2025-10-30
### Added
- Bundled `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` directly inside the SmartVideo package (`smartvideo/bin/`).
- Automatic binary discovery system (ENV ‚Üí PATH ‚Üí packaged) for seamless runtime behavior.
- Wheel packaging now includes `bin/*` files for instant, out-of-the-box video processing.

### Changed
- Updated `process.py` with unified binary resolver and improved cross-platform support.
- Adjusted `.gitignore` to allow tracking of embedded FFmpeg executables.
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to ensure packaged binaries are included in the final wheel.

### Fixed
- Eliminated ‚ÄúRequired FFmpeg tools not found‚Äù runtime error by shipping built-in binaries.
- Ensured `ensure_binaries()` gracefully falls back to packaged versions when environment paths are missing.

---

## [0.1.3] - 2025-10-30
### Added
- GitHub Actions workflow with manual trigger (`workflow_dispatch`) alongside release trigger.
- CI version logging step (Python/uv) for easier diagnostics.

### Changed
- CI uses `actions/setup-python@v5` + `pip install -U uv` for cleaner tooling.
- Streamlined publish workflow (release-only by default; manual run supported).

### Fixed
- CI smoke test now installs wheel with `uv pip --system` (fixes ‚ÄúNo virtual environment found‚Äù).
- Ensured PyPI publish step runs reliably with Trusted Publishing.

---

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-30
### Added
- Added automated PyPI publishing workflow via GitHub Actions (Trusted Publishing).
- Added optional FFmpeg auto-download step in CI to embed binaries inside the package.
- Included `uv build` + `uv publish` integration for reproducible releases.
- Added version and build information logging in CI for easier debugging.

### Changed
- Switched to `actions/setup-python@v5` for cleaner VS Code validation (no warnings).
- Simplified release workflow triggers (`release`, `push tags`, and `manual run` combined).
- Improved project structure for cross-platform packaging consistency.

### Fixed
- Removed invalid VS Code YAML warnings (`python-version` / `python` input issues).
- Ensured FFmpeg binaries are correctly detected and packaged in build artifacts.

---


## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-30
### Added
- Automatic creation of runtime folders (`data/uploads`, `data/outputs`) on first launch.
- Environment variable `SMARTVIDEO_DATA_DIR` for custom storage path.
- Unified CLI launcher (`svui`, `svapi`) with dynamic upload-size control.
- Config system (`sv/core/config.py`) for consistent data paths.

### Changed
- Moved `.streamlit/` folder to project root for proper Streamlit detection.
- Adopted `src/` layout for cleaner packaging and import safety.
- Simplified `pyproject.toml` with consolidated `package-data` section.

### Fixed
- Upload limit error (‚ÄúFile must be 200 MB or smaller‚Äù) removed permanently.
- API import path corrected (`smartvideo.sv.api:app`).
- Removed redundant platformdirs dependency for lighter package size.

---

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-30
### Added
- üé¨ Initial public release of **SmartVideo** ‚Äî FastAPI + Streamlit video toolkit.
- Added integrated **FFmpeg/FFprobe** portable binaries inside the package.
- Implemented FastAPI backend with:
  - `/upload` endpoint for video upload.
  - `/extract` for clip extraction.
  - `/thumbnails` for generating frame previews.
  - `/audio` for audio extraction (mp3/wav).
- Added Streamlit frontend with:
  - HTML5 player component.
  - Video upload, preview, and control interface.
- CLI commands:
  - `svapi` ‚Üí runs the FastAPI backend.
  - `svui` ‚Üí runs the Streamlit UI.
- Added `process.py` core service for FFmpeg integration.
- Bundled cross-platform support (Windows/Linux/macOS).

### Changed
- Project renamed from `smart-video` ‚Üí `smartvideo` for PyPI compatibility.
- Internal imports updated to `smartvideo.sv.*`.
- Unified folder structure under `src/smartvideo/`.

### Fixed
- Resolved missing module errors when packaging (`ModuleNotFoundError: sv`).
- Corrected Streamlit import paths (`smartvideo.ui.components.html5_player`).
- Fixed missing FFmpeg detection logic on non-Windows systems.
